# JIRA_Automation
Developed an automated Jira ticket creation system using historical data to streamline issue tracking. It monitors production failures and, based on predefined criteria and past incidents, auto-generates P1 tickets in Jira. This ensures prompt resolution of critical issues, reducing manual monitoring, using Python for API integration.
