# JIRA_Automation
Developed an automated Jira ticket creation system that leverages historical data to streamline issue tracking and resolution. The
system monitors for production failures and, based on predefined criteria and past incident data, automatically generates P1 tickets in
Jira. This integration ensures that critical issues are promptly documented and addressed, reducing the need for manual monitoring
and accelerating response times. The implementation uses Python to interface with the Jira API, ensuring seamless authentication
and data handling to improve operational efficiency
